## Context Prompt (Give This to Gemini First)

> I'm building a demo website for a fictional organization called the **Southern Hudson Bay Chamber of Commerce** (SHBCC). It's located in a tiny, remote community on the southern shore of Hudson Bay in subarctic Ontario, Canada. The running joke throughout the demo is that polar bears are a constant, casual presence in town — wandering past the Chamber building, peering through windows during events, etc. — and the community treats this as completely normal. There's also a ringed seal who serves as a board member, which everyone accepts without comment.
>
> The visual style should be **clean, modern, and professional** — this is a real Chamber of Commerce website that happens to exist in an absurd location. Think polished corporate photography but set in a snowy subarctic small town with polar bears. The humor comes from the contrast between the buttoned-up professionalism and the wildlife, not from cartoonish exaggeration.
>
> All images should be photorealistic. No text, watermarks, or logos overlaid on the images. Landscape orientation (16:9 or similar wide aspect ratio) unless I specify otherwise. I'll be giving you individual prompts for each image I need.

## 1. Hero Banner

> **Prompt:** A wide landscape photograph of a small, charming Chamber of Commerce building in a snowy subarctic Canadian town. The building has warm light glowing from its windows. A single adult polar bear stands outside, casually peering through the front window with its front paws on the windowsill, like a curious neighbor. Snow-covered street, soft overcast sky, early winter afternoon light. Professional architectural photography style, 16:9 aspect ratio.

### 2a. "Business After Bears" Networking Mixer

> **Prompt:** Interior photograph of a professional networking event in a warmly-lit community hall. Diverse group of people in business casual attire holding drinks and chatting in small groups.

Warm interior lighting, candid event photography style. 16:9 aspect ratio.

### 2b. "Lunch & Learn" Session

> **Prompt:** Photograph of a professional lunch-and-learn seminar in a small conference room. About 12 people seated at tables with boxed lunches, attentively watching a presenter at the front.

## 3. News/Blog Images

### 3a. "Chamber Welcomes New Board Member" (The Seal)

> **Prompt:** Photograph of a corporate boardroom meeting. Five humans in business attire sit around a polished conference table with papers and coffee cups.

### 3c. "Member Spotlight: Hudson Bay Trading Post"

> **Prompt:** Photograph of a charming small-town general store or trading post in subarctic Canada. Rustic but well-maintained wooden storefront with a welcoming entrance.
