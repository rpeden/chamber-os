The Southern Hudson Bay Chamber of Commerce has released its **2026 Economic Outlook**, and the headline is encouraging: the local business community enters the year in a position of cautious optimism, buoyed by steady tourism growth, a robust small business retention rate, and a 12% increase in new business registrations over the previous fiscal year.

"Our members have demonstrated remarkable resilience," said Executive Director Margaret Fenn. "Whether it's supply chain challenges, infrastructure limitations, or the increasingly bold wildlife presence downtown, this community adapts."

## Key Findings

**Tourism revenue** grew 8% year-over-year, driven largely by eco-tourism and northern adventure travel. The Chamber's partnership with regional outfitters has helped position Southern Hudson Bay as a destination for visitors seeking authentic subarctic experiences — which, as Fenn noted, "they certainly get."

**Small business survival rates** remain above the national average, with 87% of businesses that opened in 2023 still operating. The Chamber attributes this partly to its mentorship programs and partly to what it diplomatically calls "a self-selecting entrepreneurial population."

**The bear situation** warrants mention. Polar bear encounters in the commercial district increased 23% in 2025, consistent with broader regional trends. While this presents operational challenges — particularly for businesses with street-level signage and outdoor displays — local enterprises have adapted. Hardware store Bearings & Bolts reported that its reinforced storefront glass product line now accounts for 15% of annual revenue, a category that did not exist three years ago.

## Outlook

The Chamber's forecast models project continued moderate growth through 2026, with particular opportunity in remote work infrastructure, cold-climate construction services, and what the report terms "wildlife coexistence consulting" — a sector that barely existed five years ago and now employs fourteen people locally.

The full report is available to Chamber members through the Member Portal. A summary presentation will be given at the February Lunch & Learn on the 19th (venue confirmed bear-free as of publication).
