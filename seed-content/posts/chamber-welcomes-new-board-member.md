The Southern Hudson Bay Chamber of Commerce is proud to announce the newest addition to its Board of Directors: **Natsiq**, a ringed seal who has been a fixture of the Hudson Bay shoreline community for over a decade.

Natsiq brings a unique perspective to the board, with deep expertise in marine resource management, seasonal adaptation, and stakeholder engagement across multiple species. Their appointment fills the vacancy left by retiring board member Gerald Firth, who served the Chamber with distinction for nine years.

"Natsiq has been an active presence in our business community for as long as anyone can remember," said Board Chair Douglas Whitfield. "Their commitment to showing up — reliably, consistently, often on the front steps of the building before anyone else arrives — made this appointment a natural fit."

The new board member will serve a standard three-year term and has been assigned to the Membership & Engagement Committee.

Natsiq's first official act was attending the January board meeting, where they were described by fellow board members as "attentive" and "very present." Meeting minutes note that Natsiq abstained from voting on the revised parking policy, which colleagues attributed to a principled stance on matters outside their direct experience.

The Chamber extends its warmest welcome to Natsiq and looks forward to the fresh perspective they bring to community economic development on the southern Hudson Bay coast.
