This month's Member Spotlight shines on **Hudson Bay Trading Post**, the community's oldest continuously operating business and a cornerstone of the Southern Hudson Bay commercial district since 1987.

Owner **Janet Kowalchuk** took over the Trading Post from her parents in 2012 and has spent the last fourteen years evolving the business from a traditional general store into what she calls "a community supply chain of one."

"Out here, you can't just pop over to the next town," Kowalchuk explains. "If we don't carry it, people have to wait for a shipment or go without. That responsibility shapes everything about how we run this place."

The Trading Post stocks an improbable range of goods — from grocery staples and hardware supplies to winter gear, fishing equipment, and a surprisingly well-curated selection of paperback novels that Kowalchuk personally orders. "People are always surprised by the book section," she says. "Just because we're remote doesn't mean we don't read."

## Adapting to Change

Kowalchuk credits the Chamber's small business programs with helping her navigate the shift to online ordering and local delivery. "Margaret [Fenn, Chamber ED] connected me with a logistics consultant who helped me set up an ordering system that actually works with our shipping realities. I'm not competing with Amazon — I'm serving the people Amazon can't reach."

The Trading Post also serves as an informal community gathering point, hosting a weekly coffee morning that regularly draws fifteen to twenty locals. "Some mornings we get other visitors too," Kowalchuk notes, gesturing toward the reinforced front door. "They're less interested in the coffee."

## Chamber Membership

Kowalchuk has been a Chamber member since taking over the business and currently sits on the Economic Development Committee. "The Chamber is the connective tissue of this community," she says. "Every business up here is too small to advocate for itself. Together, through the Chamber, we actually get heard in Thunder Bay and Toronto."

Hudson Bay Trading Post is located at 14 Shoreline Road and is open Monday through Saturday, 8 AM to 6 PM. Visit their profile in the Chamber Member Directory for more information.
